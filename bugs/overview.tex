\subsection{Categories}\label{categories}

In typical WebGL applications, we might have following kinds of errors
(only the ones which \emph{will} happen every time, we don't count the
resource loading failure etc. in).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GLSL
\item
  Typo
\item
  unexpected parameter
\item
  Buffer not bound
\item
  GLSL
\item
  Resource deallocation
\item

\subsection{GLSL errors}\label{glsl-errors}

Referencing the GLSL errors in IE {[}ref \#8{]}, we can divide GLSL
errors further into:

  expression formed of the loop\_index and integer constants. For
  uniforms, the index must be an integer constant.
