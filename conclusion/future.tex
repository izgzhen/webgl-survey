\section{Future of WebGL tooling}\label{future-of-webgl-tooling}

\subsection{Static analysis technique}\label{static-analysis-technique}

The interoperation between JavaScript and GLSL opens a door for static
analysis; Besides, editors and current IDE is unaware of if you have
check \texttt{null}; The dynamic type information is simply ignored.

Also, the correct use of API involves side-effects, which is easy to get
wrong.

\subsection{Verified libraries}\label{verified-libraries}

Three.js is a huge code base, and highly dynamic. You never know if some
feature does work or it is just coincidence.

By verifying:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The library does what it is intended to do
\item
  The library does its job the right way
\end{enumerate}

We will have more confidence and rely on it in the long run.

\subsection{Integration}\label{integration}

The integration into mature product is important, such as debug tools
and IDEs.
