\section{Overview}\label{overview}

\subsection{Popular libraries}\label{popular-libraries}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  High-level libraries: BabylonJS, three.js, O3D, OSG.JS, CopperLicht
  and GLGE
\item
  Matrix libraries: gl-matrix, sylvester
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Abstractions}\label{abstractions}

Take three.js as an example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Geometry
\item
  Objects
\item
  Materials
\item
  Lights
\item
  Resource loaders
\item
  Linear algebra
\item
  Scenes
\item
  Camera
\item
  Renderer (not just WebGL)
\item
  Textures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why libraries?}\label{why-libraries}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The developer can focus on the logic of their applications/business,
  rather than the implementation details;
\item
  The third-party library's APIs are better designed to fit the language
  construct of JavaScript
\item
  The high-level library is simpler and more restricted in effects --
  which means less error-prone.
\end{enumerate}

As a result, the following errors can be eliminated by using a library:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Typo
\item
  Buffer binding
\item
  Resource Management
\item
  Lack of certain step
\item
  Missing properties
\item
  Name not in scope
\item
  Undeclared identifier
\item
  API usage error
\item
  Matrix related
\end{itemize}
